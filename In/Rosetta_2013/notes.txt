This Philips DWI dataset comes from the Rosetta Bit project (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/rosetta). Note that enhanced DICOM images can be corrupted by non-enhanced aware tools that attempt to modify the files (anonymization, using implicit VRs, etc.). This image was handled by dcm4che and seems intact.
